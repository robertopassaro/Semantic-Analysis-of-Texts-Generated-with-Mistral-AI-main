# Semantic-Analysis-of-Texts-Generated-with-Mistral-AI

This notebook contains the analysis of texts generated using the Mistral AI model with different temperatures and prompts. The objective is to study how the characteristics of semantic networks change as the generation temperature and prompt type (complex vs vague) vary.

Fundamental principles of the analysis:
- Generation of texts with controlled parameters
- Creation of semantic networks using two approaches: co-occurrence and EmoAtlas
- Metric analysis of the generated semantic networks
- Visualization of results and comparative analysis
